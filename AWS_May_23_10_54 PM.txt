Reliability
Ability to recover from failures.

Scalability
Ability to add or remove resources on demand.

Security
Access to information for authorized personnel only.

Cost-Effectiveness
Pay as you go model.

Performance Efficiency
Extracting the maximum out off your hardware and software.

Flexibility
Ability to choose from a bunch of hardware and software options.

Regions

Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
Block based storage which is attached to one EC2 instance at a time.

Backup
Centralized way of backing up services in your account.

Storage Gateway
Integrate your on-premise service with cloud(S3, EBS etc) for seamless access to information.

Datasync
Transfer data from on-premise to AWS or vice versa using the public internet.
